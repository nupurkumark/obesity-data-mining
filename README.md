**baseline_models.ipynb**: Baseline model code
**feature_engineering_models_BMI.ipynb**: All models with feature engineering (binning age and BMI)
**feature_engineering_models_with_out_BMI.ipynb**: Removed BMI to understand importance of importance of other features. We kept Age as bins since it is quite a meaningful feature that does not impact results the same way as BMI.
